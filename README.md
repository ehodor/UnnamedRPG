# UnnamedRPG
A work-in-progress RPG text-based game written in C++

Implemented so far:
- Character class with many different attributes (strength, defense, inventory, etc)
- Inventory/weapon/item/armor system
- Usable spell system in combat
- Usable potions/items in combat
- Fighting system with randomly-picked enemies
- Different enemies with different potential drops and stats
- Leveling-up system
- Location-based system which changes likelihood of different enemies spawning depending on location
- Dungeon system where a unique dungeon is attached to each location (also contains final boss)
